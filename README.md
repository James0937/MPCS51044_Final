This is my final project for the course "MPCS 51044	C/C++ for Advanced Programmers".

## Intro to Every File
# Inside the dir "mpcs51044"
lodepng: In this dictionary, I download an open-source code snippet from "https://lodev.org/lodepng/". Generally speaking, it's a library for loading the images.
HSLAPixel: This is a helper class for the pixel processing function (which is in the PNG library). I use HSLA instead of RPG because of extra practicing. RGB Processing seems to ordinary these days.
RGB_HSL: The helper file for transforming RGB format color into the HSLA format.
PNG: A class using the above libraries for image processing.

# In the main dir "Final"
Image: tbd
StickerSheet: tbd
And the destructor of "PNG" etc. should be removed after replacing raw pointers into smart pointer
